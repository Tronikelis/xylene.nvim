## Philosophy

- Minimalism
- Designed to be used with other FS plugins, I recommend [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim)


## Features
- [x] Navigating like a buffer
- [] Incremental updates
- [] `Xylene!` opens xylene with the current file already opened
- [] Search for a directory with telescope and open it
