## Philosophy

- Minimalism
- Designed to be used with other FS plugins, I recommend [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim)
- Fast, navigating should feel instant


## Features
- [x] Navigating like a buffer
- [x] Incremental rerendering of tree
- [x] `Xylene!` opens xylene with the current file already opened
- [x] Icons
- [ ] Search for a directory with telescope and open it
- [ ] Detect external file changes
